A Study of Data Pre-processing Techniques for Imbalanced Bioinformatics Data Classification

    src folder contains all source code
    
    data folder contains all data used in this study, these data are also available on the website as advised in our paper.
    
# Overview of source

Input_example.m handles the following

    Read the data from a database file
    split the data into training and testing data
    Train the classification model
    Test the classification model and output the classification performance: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, FM and AUC
    
    When use the code, please choose a classifier accordingly, for example, 1 means SVM, 2 for C4.5 decision tree, 3 for KNN, 4 for LDA, and 5 for RF.

    If one wants to apply these techniques to other imbalanced datasets, plese Format the data for the re-balanced process.
